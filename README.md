clean-box
=========

A simpler restyling of the box.com UI. Note that this is *not* a knock against the designers that put a lot of hard work into the Box UI; this UI is just more tightly catered to *my* usage patterns.

To use with Chrome:

1. Download the [Stylish extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en)
2. Select 'Write New Style' and paste in the clean-box.css
3. For 'Applies to', select **Urls on the the domain** and in the field put **box.com**
4. Click 'Save' and you're good to go! You're configuration should look something like the below screenshot.
